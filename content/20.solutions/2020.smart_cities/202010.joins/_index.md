    A Unified Vision for Smart Cities
text: |
    We are thrilled to announce that as of **January 1, 2025**, the **uCIFI Alliance** has officially become part of the **Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)**. This marks a significant milestone for both organizations, uniting their efforts to promote open standards and interoperability for smart cities and utilities on a global scale.

    Through this integration, the **uCIFI** mission and vision will not only be preserved but will flourish within OMA’s dynamic ecosystem. To build on uCIFI’s groundbreaking work, a new S[mart City]() working group will be created within OMA. This group will drive the continued development of uCIFI initiatives, including certification programs now supported by OMA. The renowned **uCIFI®** [data model](/ucifi/model) and trademark will remain integral to this effort, ensuring continuity while benefiting from OMA’s extensive resources and expertise.

    Strengthening the Mission
text: |
    Since its founding in 2019, the uCIFI Alliance has pioneered the development of open, network-agnostic standards for smart cities, enabling cities and utilities to embrace interoperable, future-proof solutions. Through collaborative efforts, the alliance has achieved significant milestones, including the adoption of the uCIFI® data model by cities like **Brussels (Sibelga)** and **Gijón**. Now, these achievements will serve as a foundation for even greater innovation under the OMA umbrella.

    OMA has long been recognized as a leader in IoT and mobile innovation. Its landmark protocols, such as **LightweightM2M (LwM2M)**, have defined IoT device management and secure communication standards. By uniting with OMA, uCIFI members gain access to a broader community, resources, and technical expertise to amplify their impact.

### Why uCIFI and OMA Are Joining Forces

The decision to transition the uCIFI Alliance into OMA stems from a shared belief in the power of collaboration and openness. By combining efforts, we ensure that the uCIFI® vision—a unified data model for smart cities and utilities—continues to evolve as a global standard. This partnership will:

- **Accelerate Standardization:** Leverage OMA’s existing standards ecosystem to enhance the uCIFI® data model and develop new, cutting-edge technical specifications.
- **Enhance Interoperability:** Simplify integration between diverse IoT devices and systems, reducing complexity and cost for cities and utilities.
- **Strengthen the Ecosystem:** Create a comprehensive certification program that supports a robust, interoperable smart city framework.

### Join Us in This Next Chapter

The integration of uCIFI into OMA is not just an evolution; it is an opportunity to bring a broader community together around a shared vision. We are committed to fostering **openness, shared growth, and technology inclusivity** as we continue to build solutions that benefit smart cities, utilities, and their communities worldwide.
