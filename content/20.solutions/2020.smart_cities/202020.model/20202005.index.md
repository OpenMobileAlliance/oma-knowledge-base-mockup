    Smart Cities Embrace Open Wireless Networks
text: |
    Smart city vendors use proprietary data formats, leading to interoperability challenges and vendor lock-in. While IoT standards like **LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, and Wi-SUN** define the physical and messaging layers, they lack a standardized **data model** for smart city applications.

    </br>

    **uCIFI® solves this issue** by introducing a **unified, open data model** that works across both proprietary and open IoT networks. **Version 2.0** already includes standardized reference objects, ensuring seamless communication between smart city devices while remaining extensible for future expansion.
