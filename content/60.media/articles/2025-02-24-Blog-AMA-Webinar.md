_**Closer collaboration between Open Mobile Alliance and uCIFI accelerates Smart City interoperability with LightWeight M2M and uCIFI Data Model**_
Late last year [we announced](https://www.openmobilealliance.org/news/articles/2024-12-9-press-release-ucifi-joins-oma){:target="_blank"} that uCIFI is joining the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA). Our collaborations to accelerate smart city technical specific development is progressing and we are inviting members of these communities and the industry at large to a special AMA event where we will share more about this work and invite questions. The event takes place Thursday, March 6, 2025 and represents the first time anyone can access the subject matter expertise across these communities live and in one place.

More than 80 percent of Smart City deployments fail, while closed technologies cost 30 percent more than open technology (SmartCitiesWorld white paper). The uCIFI and OMA work addresses this head-on by accelerating the development of specifications that enable low-power device communication, a unified data model and cross-industry compatibility for Smart City applications. Our AMA panelists Nicola Crespi, chair of the Smart City Working Group, and Matthew Gillmore, chair of the Lightweight M2M Working Group, will answer questions ranging from the deeply technical to the industry-level macro trends driving this change and innovation.  

This AMA will provide an opportunity to explore how the OMA Smart City Working Group (SCWG) is leveraging the **uCIFI data model** and the **LightWeight M2M (LwM2M) protocol** to create multi-supplier solutions for smart cities and IoT projects and how anyone can get involved.  

This is a must-attend event for industry stakeholders, reporters and analysts who are looking for an insider view on the future of smart city interoperability.
