## OMA LDAP APIs

The **OMA LDAP APIs** facilitate seamless integration with directory services by binding operations to **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)** messages. These APIs support key LDAP operations such as **AddRequest, SearchRequest, ModifyRequest, and DelRequest**, allowing developers to manage and query directory information efficiently.

By leveraging LDAP APIs, applications can perform **user authentication, access control, directory searches, and identity management** in a structured and scalable manner. These APIs ensure compatibility with enterprise directory services, making them an essential component for applications requiring **centralized user and resource management**.

Below is an overview of the available **OMA LDAP APIs** and their WebIDL protocol bindings.
